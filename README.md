# Sisyphean

A local AI agent engine that runs as a background service. It exposes both the Anthropic Messages API (`/v1/messages`) and OpenAI Chat Completions (`/v1/chat/completions`), making it a drop-in model provider for Claude Code, BirdClaw, and any OpenAI-compatible client.

Sisyphean is the **engine** — stateless, reasoning-focused, no personality. Pair it with [BirdClaw](https://github.com/sangharshadhyeta/BirdClaw) for a full autonomous agent with soul, dreaming, and a persistent web UI.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# First-time setup (LLM backend, port, workspace)
python main.py setup

# Start the engine
python main.py

# Or start with the system tray icon (recommended on Windows)
python main.py tray
```

Engine runs at `http://127.0.0.1:47291` by default.

---

## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` (created by `python main.py setup`):

```yaml
llm:
  local_model: "qwen3:0.6b"    # Ollama model name (if using Ollama)
  server:
    port: 11434                  # Ollama port

  external_api:                  # Use OpenRouter, LM Studio, llama.cpp, etc.
    enabled: true
    base_url: "http://192.168.1.x:8081/v1"
    api_key: "local"
    model: "gemma-4-E4B-it-Q8_0.gguf"

api:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 47291

mock: false                      # true = no model needed (for UI/API testing)
workspace: ./workspace           # sandboxed directory; agent writes only here
```

---

## Claude Code Integration

Add Sisyphean as a custom model in Claude Code's settings:

```json
{
  "customApiUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:47291",
  "customApiKey": "local"
}
```

Claude Code sends requests to `/v1/messages` (Anthropic format). Sisyphean routes them through its agent loop and returns `tool_use` / `end_turn` responses.

---

## BirdClaw Integration

BirdClaw (the harness) routes every task to Sisyphean via `BC_ENGINE_URL`. Set this in `~/.birdclaw/.env`:

```bash
BC_ENGINE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:47291
```

Or run `install.bat` in BirdClaw — it configures this automatically.

## Agent Loop

Every `/v1/messages` request enters `TranslationLoop.process()`:

1. **Continuation check** — if the previous message has `tool_result` blocks, decode `SISYPHEAN_STATE:<base64-json>` from a thinking block and resume `MicroState` (step count, internal messages, summary, pending write steps).
2. **`_micro_loop()`** — up to 12 inner steps:
   - If a `write_code`/`write_doc` step is queued in `pending_write_steps`, dispatch to the subtask pipeline (planner → writer → verifier).
   - Otherwise call `decide()` — one LLM call returns an action.
   - **Internal tools** handled inside the loop: `plan_task`, `search_knowledge`, `search_history`, `save_memory`, `web_search`, `list_workspace`, `read_file`.
   - **Outer tools** (e.g., `bash`) returned as `tool_use` blocks to the caller; current state encoded in a thinking block for the next turn.
3. **Forced answer** — if MAX_STEPS exceeded, a final synthesis call produces the answer.

No stage gating — the model decides freely at every step. All actions always available: think, search_memory, search_history, web_search, list_workspace, read_file, save_memory, bash, answer.

Stall guard blocks duplicate (tool, input) calls. Semantic history uses Jaccard similarity ≥ 0.15 over session logs with one LLM summary call per outer turn.

---

## Internal Tools

| Tool | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `plan_task` | Complex multi-step tasks — produces typed stage list |
| `list_workspace` | Before mkdir or file writes — shows what exists |
| `read_file` | Before modifying a file — reads relevant portion |
| `search_memory` | Domain knowledge or past research from the graph |
| `search_history` | What was done in previous sessions |
| `save_memory` | Persist a fact or preference to the knowledge graph |
| `web_search` | Current information not in model knowledge |

---

## Memory

- **Knowledge graph** (`memory/graph.json`) — NetworkX graph of facts, concepts, and entities extracted during task execution.
- **Artifact store** (`memory/artifacts.jsonl`) — JSONL log of significant outputs.
- **Session log** — per-session JSONL conversation log used by semantic history.

> Memory consolidation (dreaming) lives in **BirdClaw**, not in Sisyphean. Sisyphean's graph is populated automatically during task execution by `MemoryExtractor`.

---

## System Tray

```bash
python main.py tray
```

Launches the engine in the background and shows a tray icon in the Windows notification area. Right-click for Start / Stop / Restart / View Logs / Update (git pull + restart).

> **If the icon doesn't appear:** Windows hides new tray icons in the overflow area. Click the `^` arrow in the taskbar notification area and drag the Sisyphean icon to the visible bar, or go to **Settings → Personalisation → Taskbar → Other system tray icons** and enable it.

The tray includes a watchdog that automatically restarts the engine if it crashes.

## Dashboard

Browse to `http://127.0.0.1:47291/dashboard` for a live status page showing uptime, graph nodes, artifact count, active tasks, and recent events.

---

## Development

```bash
# Mock mode — no model needed, useful for testing API shape
# Set mock: true in config.yaml, then:
python main.py

# Re-run setup wizard to change settings
python main.py setup

# Open BirdClaw web UI in browser
python main.py launch birdclaw
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Switch to llama.cpp + gemma4 e4b (better reasoning on consumer GPU)
- [ ] Telegram / Discord channel adapters
- [ ] PC control (screenshot, mouse/keyboard) via BirdClaw tool bridge
- [ ] Self-modification (agent edits own source, runs tests, commits)
